# 61. REST APIS

API REVIEW

- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other.
- APIs are essential not just for network automation but for all kinds of applications
- In SDN Architecture, APIs are use to communicate between apps and the SDN controller (via the NBI) and between the SDN controller and the network devices (via the SBI)
- The NBI typically uses REST APIs
- NETCONF and RESTCONF are popular Southbound APIs

CRUD OPERATIONS AND HTTP VERBS

- CRUD ( CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) refers to the operations we perform using REST APIs

- CREATE :
    - Used to CREATE new variables and set their initial values
        - Example:  create a variable ‚Äúip_address‚Äù and set the value to ‚Äú10.1.1.1‚Äù

- READ :
    - Used to READ the value of a variable
        - Example: Read the value of variable ‚Äúip_address‚Äù (‚Äù10.1.1.1‚Äù)

- UPDATE :
    - Used to CHANGE / UPDATE the value of a variable
        - Example: Change the value of ‚Äúip_address‚Äù from ‚Äú10.1.1.1‚Äù to ‚Äú10.2.3.4‚Äù
    
- DELETE :
    - Used to DELETE variables
        - Example: Delete variable ‚Äúip_address‚Äù

- HTTP uses *verbs* (aka. methods) that map to these CRUD operations
- REST APIs typically use HTTP

HTTP REQUEST :

- When an HTTP client sends a request to an HTTP server, the HTTP header includes information like this:
    - An HTTP Verb (ie: GET)
    - A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) indicating the resource it is trying to access

An example of a URI (demonstrated later)

- The HTTP request can include additional headers which pass additional information to the server.

Check the list at  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers

- An example would be an ACCEPT header, which informs the server about the types(s) of data that can be sent back to the client.
    - Example: **Accept: application/json** or **Accept: application/xml**

- You can also view standard HTTP header fields with some examples at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields

- When a REST client makes an API call (request) to a REST server, it will send an HTTP request like the one above

> üí° REST APIs do NOT have to use HTTP for communication, although HTTP is the most common choice 

---

HTTP RESPONSE :

- The server‚Äôs response will include a STATUS CODE indicating if the request succeeded or failed, as well as other details
- The FIRST digit indicates the class of the response:
    - 1xx : Informational - request was received, continuing process
    - 2xx : Successful - request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
    - 3xx : Redirection - further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
    - 4xx : Client Error - request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
    - 5xx : Server Error - server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/1ab2d4c3-11c1-4189-9a44-ae0f6405536c)

Examples of each HTTP Response class:

- 1xx Informational
    - 102 Processing indicates that the server received the request and is processing it but the response is not available yet

- 2xx Successful
    - 200 OK **indicates that the request succeeded
    - 201 Created indicates the request succeeded and a new resource was created

- 3xx Redirection
    - 301 Moved Permanently indicates that the request resource has been moved and the server indicates its new location

- 4xx Client Error
    - 403 Unauthorized means the client must authenticate to get a response
    - 404 Not Found means the requested resource was not found

- 5xx Server Error
    - 500 Internal Server Error means the server encountered something unexpected that it doesn‚Äôt know how to handle

REST APIs

- REST stands for Representational State Transfer
- REST APIs are also know as REST-based APIs or RESTful APIs
    - REST isn‚Äôt a specific API. Instead it describes a set of rules about how the API should work
    
- The SIX constraints of RESTful architecture are:
    - Stateless
    - Layered system
    - Uniform Interface
    - Client-Server
    - Cacheable or non-cacheable
    - Code-on-Demand (optional)

- For applications to communicate over a network, networking protocols must be used to facilitate those communications
    - For REST APIs, HTTP(S) is the most common choice

---

REST: Client-Server

- REST APIs use a client-server architecture
- The client uses API calls (HTTP requests) to access the resources on the server
- The separation between the client and server means they can both change and evolve independently of each other
    - When the client application changes or the server application changes, the interface between them must not break

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/e39d0588-8e4c-441b-97b9-c2345bf09342)

---

REST: Stateless

- REST APIs exchanges are STATELESS
- This means that each API exchange is a separate event, independent of all past exchanges between the client and server
    - The server does not store information about previous requests from the client to determine how it should respond to new requests
- If authentication is required, this means that the client must authenticate with the server for each request it makes
- TCP is an example of a STATEFUL protocol
- UDP is an example of  STATELESS protocol

** Although REST APIs use HTTP, which uses TCP (STATEFUL) as it‚Äôs LAYER 4 protocol, HTTP and REST APIs themselves aren‚Äôt STATEFUL. The functions of each layer are separate ! 

---

REST: Cacheable or Non-Cacheable 

- REST APIs must support caching of data
- *Caching* refers to storing data for future use
    - Example :
        - Your computer might cache many elements of a web page so it doesn‚Äôt have to retrieve the entire page every time you visit. This improves performance for the client and reduces load on the server
- Not all resources have to be cacheable but cacheable resources MUST be declared as cacheable

REST API CALLS USING CISCO DEVNET

- ‚ÄúCisco DevNet is Cisco‚Äôs developer program to help developers and IT professionals who want to write applications and develop integrations with Cisco products, platforms, and API‚Äôs‚Äù

- DevNet offers lots of free resources such as courses, tutorials, labs, sandboxes, documentation, etc to learn about AUTOMATION and develop your skills

- There is also a DevNet certification track that you can pursue if you are interested in AUTOMATION

- We will use their Cisco DNA Center Sandbox to send a REST API call using Postman
    - DNA Center is one of Cisco‚Äôs SDN Controllers (covered in more detail later)
    - Postman is a platform for building an using APIs
